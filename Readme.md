Air Gesture Recognition

Air Gesture Recognition is a creative project that lets you transfer images across tabs or devices using hand gestures. With a simple grab-and-drop gesture, you can move images wherever you want, making the process fully contactless.

This project combines real-time gesture detection, custom gesture training, and an interactive UI, offering a futuristic and fun way to interact with your computer.
